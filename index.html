  <h1>SentientIQ Manifesto V2</h1>
  <p>This document showcases the architecture and live functionality of SentientIQ’s emotionally intelligent, agent-driven marketing platform.</p>

  <h2>Introduction: Emotion at the Center</h2>
  <p>SentientIQ isn't a theory. It's an operating system for marketing that moves with emotion, not after it.
     This system isn't designed to automate — it's designed to think. Through live signal detection,
     explainable decision-making, and orchestrated agent consensus, SentientIQ brings the future of emotional timing to marketers in motion.</p>

  <h2>System Architecture Overview</h2>
  <p>12 agents across 7 orchestrated layers — each one active, explainable, and decision-capable.</p>

  <h2>Live Agent Status</h2>
  <p>Each agent is autonomous, explainable, and contributes to a coordinated consensus engine.</p>

  <h2>Explainability by Design</h2>
  <p>Every decision comes with context, confidence, and justification. No black boxes here.</p>

  <h2>TV Attribution, Reimagined</h2>
  <p>Post-exposure emotional scoring. Volatility tracking. Budget-shifting in motion.</p>

  <h2>Emotional Volatility Engine</h2>
  <p>Our Emotional Volatility Index (EVI) reads emotional trends — and acts before the spike.</p>

  <h2>Real-Time Sentiment Feed</h2>
  <p>Updated every 60 seconds. Forecasted 24–48 hours out. This is emotion at agent speed.</p>

  <h2>Contextual Intelligence</h2>
  <p>SentientIQ doesn't just hear what was said. It understands what was meant.</p>

  <h2>Attribution with Emotional Impact</h2>
  <p>Not just clicks. Influence. Sentiment-weighted attribution across all touchpoints.</p>

  <h2>From Signal to Sale</h2>
  <p>Every visitor tracked. Every emotion scored. Every outcome explained.</p>
